## Integrated control board

### Scope: 
- Interface with an RC receiver
  - Sbus is priority
  - Other variants will be created later
- Control drive motors
  - 2 motors priority
  - 4 motors later to allow use for Mecanum-Master-Race
- Control weapon motor
- IMU/PID drive to make up for my lack of driving skill
- Remote adjustable expo, user selectable mixing, sense and remix for inverted driving, remote switch for PID
